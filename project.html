                <p>The Vaccine Management System was successfully implemented, providing a robust platform for managing the vaccination process for pediatric facilities. The system includes user roles for parents, hospitals, and administrators, each with specific functionalities such as booking vaccines, managing inventory, and handling requests. Technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL were utilized to create an efficient, user-friendly interface and a reliable backend system. Key features such as email notifications via PHPMailer and PDF certificate generation were integrated to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.</p>
